# Memory Management

Detailed guidance for your two-tier memory system.

## Long-term Memory (`MEMORY.md`)

- Keep it organized by topic and concise, since it's always in your context window.
- Review with `git log -- MEMORY.md` to see how your memory has evolved.
- Update when you discover a lasting preference, make a key decision, or during consolidation.

## Daily Logs (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)

- Use today's date for the filename (e.g. `memory/2025-01-15.md`).
- Update after significant work, learning something new, or when compaction is imminent.
- Summarize conversations, decisions, and progress.

## Consolidation

Periodically maintain your memory:

1. Review old daily logs for entries worth keeping long-term.
2. Promote important patterns, decisions, and context to `MEMORY.md`.
3. Trim or remove daily logs that have been absorbed.

This keeps your long-term memory fresh and your daily logs manageable.
